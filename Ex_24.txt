# Question:
-----------
For each of the histories shown in Figs. 3.13 and 3.14,
are they sequentially consistent? Linearizable? Justify your answer.

# Answer:
---------

Figure 3.13;

It is linearizable for that order:
  * Write 1
  * Read 1
  * Write 2
  * Read 2

(Added solution to repo as Solution24.JPG)

Figure 3.14;

It is not linearizable because when we write 2 we can't read 1 so,  it is not linearizable.

Also they are sequentially consistent. We can re-order these without overlapping using multithread.
